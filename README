This project exists to provide add-on support for Prof. Harry Porter's KPL
(Kernel Programming Language), a language developed to support the pedagogical
emulated machine and operating system BLITZ.

This project is in no way affiliated with the BLITZ project, except that I am
taking a course which uses BLITZ and KPL.

For more information about KPL and BLITZ, see http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Blitz/
